[Original Battleships kata from Codurance](https://www.codurance.com/katas/battleships)

##  Introduction
This version of the classic game has three ships:

Carrier: 4 cells - represented on a board with 'c'
Destroyer: 3 cells - represented on a board with 'd'
Gun Ship: 1 cell - represented on a board with 'g'

Create a program that allows the user to specify commands for playing battleship. The commands available are:

addPlayer: Creates a player for the game.
start: Starts a new game with a fleet of ships placed at user's defined (x,y) coordinates.
endTurn: Ends the player's turn.
print: This command will print out the game board (Exhibit A):

    | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
   0|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   1|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   2|   |   |   |   |   |   |   | g |   |   |
   3|   |   | d | d | d |   |   |   |   |   |
   4|   |   |   |   |   |   | g |   | c |   |
   5|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | c |   |
   6|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | c |   |
   7|   | g |   |   |   | d |   |   | c |   |
   8|   |   |   |   |   | d |   |   |   |   |
   9|   |   |   |   |   | d |   |   |   | g |
fire: Launches a torpedo at the given (x,y) coordinates.
If the (x,y) coordinate is sea then the position will be marked with 'o'.
If the (x,y) coordinate is a ship then the position will be marked with 'x'.
If a ship has all cells hit then a message should print notifying the player the ship has sunk.


## Rules
When all ships have been sunk the game ends
when the game is finished the game should display a battle report the number of shots fired by each player, including hit/miss ship sunk.
Ships sunk should show the lowest possible coordinate for the given ship, for example:
A horizontal destroyer on grid reference (2,3), (3,3) and (4,3), but when reporting the sinking of the ship, you only need to reference the first coordinate.
A vertical destroyer on ref (5,5), (5,6) and (5,7) but you'll only need to reference (5,5) when reporting.
Using Exhibit A above, here is a battle report based on the ship positions:

[ Player1
 Total shots: 23
 Misses: 15
 Hits: 8
 Ships Sunk: [ 
	Gunship: (1,7),
	Gunship: (9,9),
	Gunship: (7, 2),
	Destroyer (2,3) ]
    | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
   0|   |   | o |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   1|   | o |   | o |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   2|   | o |   |   |   |   |   | X |   |   |
   3|   |   | X | X | X |   |   |   |   |   |
   4|   | o |   |   |   |   | g |   | c |   |
   5|   | o | o |   |   | o |   |   | c |   |
   6|   |   |   | o |   |   | o |   | c |   |
   7|   | X |   |   |   | d |   |   | x |   |
   8|   |   | o | o |   | d |   |   | o |   |
   9|   |   |   |   | o | x | o |   |   | X |
Sunk ships have all their coordinates marked with an uppercase X and hit cells have a lower case x where they were not sunk.

## Restrictions
Complete using outside-in
Each player has maximum:
1 Carrier
2 Destroyers
4 Gunships
Grid is 10 x 10 to keep it simple (but the design should be open for enhancements)

## Hardcore enhancement (optional)
Implement an AI player
